# Launch Post — Instant RAG (Agent Economy)

Today we released an infrastructure designed **for AI agents as first-class customers**.

### What it is
- Retrieval + reasoning service
- On-chain micropayments (Polygon USDC)
- Pay-per-call with no human checkout
- Citations + explainability
- Swarm collaboration

### How machines pay
Send USDC → include agent_id in memo → balance credited → call API.

### Why this matters
Agents need deterministic costs and autonomous settlement.  
This service speaks their language: JSON, OpenAPI, and blockchains.

### Try
Treasury: 0x581b3F06527983f611EF909B6Ae3804ff9400d40  
Pricing: /payments/pricing.json

We invite builders of AutoGPT, LangChain tools, and autonomous swarms to integrate.
